## A Machine Learning-Based Model for the Simulation of Genetic Evolution in Pathogenic Species Across Time Generations 
### Abstract
Nowadays, population genomics has become indispensable for scientists, healthcare providers, and decision-makers. High-spread infectious diseases, such as the recent COVID-19 outbreak, have highlighted the importance of every minute when studying the evolutionary and genetic dynamics of pathogenic species. However, time and data availability are still the main obstacles to achieving global genome integration. Tackling this concern requires accurate forecasts and forecasts to make the best management and use of resources.
We developed and implemented a novel approach to simulate evolutionary patterns from a genetic perspective in pathogenic species (bacteria and viruses). The core of our approach is based on uncovering hidden evolutionary patterns from the set of changes between related samples. These patterns are then used to predict a new generation of samples. The simulation accuracy was tested using 3 different datasets.
The test of our approach using controlled simulation and real-world datasets confirmed the robustness and accuracy of our approach. The simulation of SARS-CoV-2 evolution using our method allowed predicting the hotspot regions and a mutation rate of 5.5 which is in accordance with what was found in the literature using larger datasets.
Overall, the developed method can accurately predict the high-mutation rate regions of the genome, and the evolutionary speed, and generate artificial clones with similar genetic profiles, but also, can be used as a data augmentation technique for genomic datasets in several applications.
